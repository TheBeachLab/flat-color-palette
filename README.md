# Flat color palette for Inkscape

A nice 45 flat colors palette for drawing characters. Original selection by [Gigantic](https://gigantic.store/gigantic-color-pallet/). Recreated for Inkscape by Francisco Sanchez Arroyo. Just copy the `characters.gpl` file to `/usr/share/inkscape/palettes/` (in Linux)

```bash
sudo cp characters.gpl /usr/share/inkscape/palettes/
```
